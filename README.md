# Ramy523.github.io

This is a portfolio website created using HTML and CSS by Ramy Hammam. 

The website includes a header with a navigation menu that links to my linkedin and github.

The "About Me" section provides an introduction to myself, while the "My Work" section showcases some of my previous projects with links to their repositories.

The "Skills" section lists my areas of expertise in software development, and the "Contact Me" section includes a contact form for potential clients or collaborators to get in touch.

The website also features a clickable logo at the top that will smoothly scroll back to the top of the page when clicked.

To customize this website for your own use, simply modify the HTML and CSS files as needed.
